            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Little Intended, God knows, to bring theſe ſcraps of Learning to the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket for publick ſale, moſt whereof have lain by me for many Years, as thinking them too juvenile for Publick Notice in this Critical Age: For in my younger dayes, to help my Memory, I kept by me a Paper-Book, wherein I inſerted ſome of thoſe things which did occurr to me in my Reading as moſt remarkable, and which I had a deſire to treaſure in my Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory. And a while ſince acquainting a young Student in Philoſoyhy and Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty what I had done, he earneſtly ſolicited me that they might be made publick, as
<pb facs="tcp:52250:3"/>that which might be of uſe, eſpecially to the younger ſort of Schollars, whoſe minds have not yet been exerciſed with graver Studies, which firſt put it into my mind to put them to the Preſs.</p>
            <p>And I now expoſe them as I find them in my Paper-Book, extracted now out of one Author, then out of another, and now written at one time, then at another; now a paſſage in Humanity, then in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity; now of Poetry then of Hiſtory; now out of the Scriptures, then out of Expoſitors; now in Philology, then is Philoſophy. I mingled all together, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out obſerving any method, and my Pen like the Bee skipt from Flower to Flower: So that the Reader muſt take them as he finds them, and make the beſt uſe of them he can. It may be he may find ſome things that may add to his Knowledge, and be pleaſing to his Mind, as they were to mine own, and as the Bee, he may gather ſome Honey out of theſe Flowers.</p>
            <p>All the Method I have uſed, is only to parcel them into ſeveral Centuries, and
<pb facs="tcp:52250:3"/>diſtinguiſh them by Figures one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And what is found in them of Language, that none but Schollars under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, I have for the moſt part put into Engliſh. And ſometimes I find in my Paper-Book I have quoted the Author of what I have remarked, and ſometimes not: And I cannot well recollect whence I had ſome Notions and Sayings, which I put into my Paper-book above thirty Years agoe; and being thus put together, are like a Chain of Gold, or String of Pearls.</p>
            <p>I call them in the Title <hi>Intellectual Flowers,</hi> and we know 'tis proper and pleaſant to have many diſtinct Flowers tyed together in a Noſe-gay, though of ſeveral ſorts, and gathered out of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Gardens: And if any will cenſure them as a Rhapſody, I confeſs they may be ſo ſtyled, yet I am not the firſt who hath expoſed Rhapſodies to publick view, taking the word in a more general ſenſe. And hath not <hi>Solomon</hi> himſelf lead the way to ſuch a kind of Writing, in his Book of <hi>Proverbs,</hi> which are ſet down
<pb facs="tcp:52250:4"/>for the moſt part, without any Method, or dependance one upon another? And we know the old ſaying, <hi>Varietas delectat,</hi> Variety Delights; and if the Reader finds nothing elſe, he will find that in theſe Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers. And this I hope may be ſome Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy for my preſent Adventure, which elſe may be cenſured as pedantick and ſingular.</p>

               <p n="76">76.
